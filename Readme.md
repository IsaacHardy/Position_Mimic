#Position Mimic

###In this project, I was given a webpage ([Linked Here](https://github.com/tiy-atl-js-sept-2015/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment-03/octodex.png)) and was asked to create a duplicate copy on my own. 

##Practices used to perform this task:

* Positions: Distiguished between float, absolute, static, and relative.
* Using :before and :after of a tag to create images
* Manipulate web pages using browser tools to enhance the developing experience
* Branch creation from a master file through git and github interactions 
* Finding solutions through problem solving

This type of project was extremely useful and challenged me to solve issues without concrete knowledge of positional manipulations through CSS.
